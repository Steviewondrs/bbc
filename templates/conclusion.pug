    h2 This anniversary is about you

    p It all started with a tiny satellite.
    p Twenty years ago, a close cooperation between EU countries and the European Commission culminated into <b>the launch of Spot-4 VEGETATION</b>. A spacecraft that would go on to improve our understanding of the world and its ecosystems.
    p VITO Remote Sensing took off as the image processing centre for the mission, translating earth observation images to new data and insights.

    p But much more than the start of our remote sensing activities, March 24 1998 was <b>a celebration of cooperation and knowledge sharing in general. A day that was much less about tech, than about the people behind it. This anniversary really is about you.
    p Join us to celebrate this occasion together with your peers.
