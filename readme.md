This is a landing page for a non exisiting campaign, for which I hope to land a job.


TODO:
1. Info  => weather map img and title
2. Schedule => globe img
3. Diagonal lines in background
4. Responsiveness --> bugfix with the parallax
5. Dropshadows on certain sections

NICE TO HAVE:
1. Grunt build step to compile js files (pref. with babel).
2. Animations on links
3. Burger nav menu on mobile.
