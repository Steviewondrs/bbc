This is a landing page for a non exisiting campaign, for which I hope to land a job.


TODO:
1. ~~Footer => Terms of use * Privacy Policy links (align right)~~
2. ~~HEADER => Styling nav links~~
3. Info  => weather map img and title
4. Schedule => globe img
5. Diagonal lines in background
6. ~~Parallax effect~~
7. Responsiveness --> bugfix with the parallax
8. Dropshadows on certain sections

NICE TO HAVE:
1. Grunt build step to compile js files (pref. with babel).
2. Animations on links
3. Burger nav menu on mobile.
